1. Create a server using Express to manage books. A book has properties: id, title, ISBN, publishedDate, author.

    "publishedDate": "Jan 1, 2022",
    "author": "Thao Vu"
}
`

* Save all books in the file 'book.json' and load that file when starting the server
4. Implement GET `http://localhost:3000/books`, which returns all books
5. Implement PUT `http://localhost:3000/books/{id}` with the body
{
    "title": "Server-side programming"
}
* This request will trigger updating the title of the book with id
6. Implement DELETE `http://localhost:3000/books/{id}`, which delete the book with id
7. Implement GET `http://localhost:3000/books/{id}`, which returns the book with id
